# Sentinel

<Note>
Sentinel is in development. This page describes what's coming.
</Note>

Sentinel is the inbound protection layer. It validates AI-generated code before you use it.

## The problem

AI can generate code that:

- Has security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Uses copyleft-licensed code in your proprietary project
- Violates your team's coding standards
- Includes deprecated or dangerous APIs

You catch these in code review... if you notice them.

## What Sentinel will do

**Security scanning**
- SQL/NoSQL injection patterns
- Command injection
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Insecure crypto usage
- Hardcoded secrets (yes, AI sometimes adds new ones)

**License compliance**
- Detect GPL/AGPL code in proprietary projects
- Flag license-incompatible dependencies
- Identify code that looks like known open source

**Custom rules**
- Your team's patterns to enforce
- Your team's patterns to forbid
- Framework-specific best practices

## Planned API

```typescript
import { createSentinel } from '@takumo/sentinel';

const sentinel = createSentinel({
  rules: ['security', 'license'],
  licensePolicy: 'permissive-only',  // No copyleft
  customRules: './takumo-rules.yaml'
});

// Validate before using AI-generated code
const result = await sentinel.validate(aiGeneratedCode);

if (!result.passed) {
  console.log('Issues found:');
  for (const issue of result.issues) {
    console.log(`  ${issue.severity}: ${issue.message}`);
    console.log(`    Line ${issue.line}: ${issue.snippet}`);
  }
}
```
